## Learning ggplot2 ##
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
mpg
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4)
```

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point()
```

Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs `cty` with different size points representing each `class` and different colors for each `fuel type` (fl).

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cty, size = class, color = fl)) + geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, color = "blue")
```
Anthing in aes should refer to a column in your dataset.  Don't use "" within aes for variables bc creates new column.
